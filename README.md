# LOG - a MERN application
*Live version found [here](logmaker.herokuapp.com/)*

## Why?
An app to teach me how to create an app with a `nodejs`-`express` back-end, `react` front-end and with a `mongodb` database and then deploy it to heroku.

## Description
The app uses a simple registration/login after which the user is presented their dashboard of logs. The dashboard displays the last five used logs, allows the user to search for all logs and also create new logs.

Opening a log brings the user to the log entry display. Logs are sorted by creation date, with the top most one being the latest. The user can also edit/delete log entries and the log itself.

## Future improvements
- [x] Implement a markdown interpreter for the log entries
- [ ] Add details, such as links to here etc.
- [ ] Comment the code.
- [ ] A way for the user to view all logs in a list.
- [ ] Limit the number of logs one user can have.
- [ ] Test new designs
