# LOG - a MERN application
*Live version found [here](logmaker.herokuapp.com/)*

An app to teach me how to create an app with a `nodejs`-`express` back-end, `react` front-end and with a `mongodb` database and then deploy it to heroku.

## Planned improvements
- Implement a markdown interpreter for the log entries
